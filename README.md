# 🧬 Roche ML Bio Research

Welcome to my personal research portfolio — a collection of deep learning projects and experiments prepared in anticipation of the **Machine Learning Scientist – Large Molecule Drug Discovery** role at **Roche, Basel**.

This repository demonstrates:
- Application of **foundational models** in biological domains
- Use of **LLMs and agents** for therapeutic design
- Deep learning with **PyTorch and JAX**
- Understanding of **biological sequences**, **protein modeling**, and **drug discovery pipelines**

---

## 🧠 Why This Repo?

This repo showcases my ability to:
- Independently **design and implement novel ML approaches** for biological data
- Build **reproducible experiments** with real and synthetic protein datasets
- Integrate recent advances in **self-supervised learning** and **transformer models**
- Create tools that align with **Roche's mission** to improve human health through data-driven discovery

## 🚀 Project Highlights

### `01_toy_mlp_fasta/`
> **MLP on synthetic protein sequences**  
A simple yet complete PyTorch pipeline that classifies protein sequences using one-hot encoding + MLP.  
Used as a starting point for benchmarking more complex models later.

---

### `02_foundational_llm_drug_design/`
> **LLMs + molecular representation learning**  
An exploration of LLM-style architectures (e.g., BioBERT, MolBERT, ProtGPT2) applied to biological sequences and SMILES data. Includes embeddings, fine-tuning, and inference.

---

### `03_paper_reproduction_project/`
> **Reproducing and extending key papers**  
Select academic works (e.g., ESM-2, AlphaFold modules, or Roche/Prescient papers) reimplemented and extended with new experiments.

---

### `04_rag_agent_molecule_qna/` *(Planned)*
> **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) agent**  
Prototype RAG chatbot trained on internal literature to simulate Roche use cases. Can answer domain-specific questions related to drug targets, trials, or molecular features.
