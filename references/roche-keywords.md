# Roche ML Scientist ‚Äì Key Concepts

## üî¨ Scientific Focus
- Large Molecule Drug Discovery (LMDD)

**Large Language Molecule Discovery (LLMD)** refers to the use of **large language models (LLMs)** ‚Äî originally developed for human language ‚Äî in the domain of **biological and chemical sequences**, such as proteins (FASTA), DNA/RNA, or small molecules (SMILES), with the goal of accelerating **therapeutic discovery**.

These models are trained on massive biomolecular datasets to learn their **syntax, structure, and semantics**, enabling applications like:

- Predicting protein **function, folding, or structure**
- Designing **new antibodies, peptides, or protein scaffolds**
- Modeling **molecular interactions** (e.g., binding or immunogenicity)
- Generating novel molecules with desired properties
- Building **agents** for scientific reasoning and knowledge retrieval

## üí° Core Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Protein Language Models** | LLMs trained on amino acid sequences (e.g. ESM-2, ProtGPT2) to learn biological "grammar" |
| **SMILES Transformers** | LLMs for chemical strings (e.g. ChemBERTa, MolBERT) that model molecular properties |
| **Masked Language Modeling (MLM)** | A self-supervised training objective where random tokens are masked and predicted |
| **Transfer Learning** | Using pretrained LLMs and fine-tuning on smaller, task-specific biological datasets |
| **LLM Agents** | LLMs enhanced with tools (e.g., databases, structure prediction APIs) to reason about biology and chemistry |
| **Structure-Conditioned Generation** | Generating sequences that are constrained by structural, physical, or functional parameters |

## üß™ Application Domains

| Field | Use Case |
|-------|----------|
| **Immunology** | Predict antigen-antibody binding, design immune-stable sequences |
| **Oncology** | Generate cancer-targeting peptides or inhibitory proteins |
| **Rare Diseases** | Predict mutation impact on protein function or misfolding |
| **Drug Repurposing** | Use embeddings to find molecular similarity or therapeutic overlap |
| **Synthetic Biology** | Generate entirely new proteins or enzymes with desired functions |
