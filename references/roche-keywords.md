# Roche ML Scientist ‚Äì Key Concepts

## üî¨ Scientific Focus
- Large Molecule Drug Discovery (LMDD)

**Large Language Molecule Discovery (LLMD)** refers to the use of **large language models (LLMs)** ‚Äî originally developed for human language ‚Äî in the domain of **biological and chemical sequences**, such as proteins (FASTA), DNA/RNA, or small molecules (SMILES), with the goal of accelerating **therapeutic discovery**.

These models are trained on massive biomolecular datasets to learn their **syntax, structure, and semantics**, enabling applications like:

- Predicting protein **function, folding, or structure**
- Designing **new antibodies, peptides, or protein scaffolds**
- Modeling **molecular interactions** (e.g., binding or immunogenicity)
- Generating novel molecules with desired properties
- Building **agents** for scientific reasoning and knowledge retrieval

## üí° Core Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Protein Language Models** | LLMs trained on amino acid sequences (e.g. ESM-2, ProtGPT2) to learn biological "grammar" |
| **SMILES Transformers** | LLMs for chemical strings (e.g. ChemBERTa, MolBERT) that model molecular properties |
| **Masked Language Modeling (MLM)** | A self-supervised training objective where random tokens are masked and predicted |
| **Transfer Learning** | Using pretrained LLMs and fine-tuning on smaller, task-specific biological datasets |
| **LLM Agents** | LLMs enhanced with tools (e.g., databases, structure prediction APIs) to reason about biology and chemistry |
| **Structure-Conditioned Generation** | Generating sequences that are constrained by structural, physical, or functional parameters |

## üß™ Application Domains

| Field | Use Case |
|-------|----------|
| **Immunology** | Predict antigen-antibody binding, design immune-stable sequences |
| **Oncology** | Generate cancer-targeting peptides or inhibitory proteins |
| **Rare Diseases** | Predict mutation impact on protein function or misfolding |
| **Drug Repurposing** | Use embeddings to find molecular similarity or therapeutic overlap |
| **Synthetic Biology** | Generate entirely new proteins or enzymes with desired functions |

## üè≠ Roche & Prescient Design‚Äôs Focus

Roche ‚Äî and its AI-first biotech unit **Prescient Design** ‚Äî are at the forefront of LLMD, actively developing:

- **Foundational models** for large molecule drug discovery (e.g., antibodies, biologics)
- Systems combining **biological priors with generative models**
- **Agents** capable of retrieving, reasoning, and designing across complex biological datasets

Their mission is to enable **autonomous scientific discovery** through deeply integrated AI and domain-specific biological modeling.

- Protein structure-function prediction
**Protein structure-function prediction** is the task of using computational methods ‚Äî especially **machine learning** and **molecular modeling** ‚Äî to predict how a protein's **structure** (its 3D shape) determines or influences its **function** (what it does in the body).

It is based on the biological principle that:

> **"Structure determines function."**  
> A protein's 3D conformation directly governs how it interacts with other molecules, which defines its role in biological processes.

## üß¨ Key Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Primary structure** | The raw amino acid sequence (FASTA format) |
| **Secondary/tertiary structure** | Local folding patterns (e.g., alpha helices, beta sheets) and the full 3D shape |
| **Function** | What the protein does: binding, signaling, catalysis, structural support, etc. |
| **Prediction Goal** | Infer a protein‚Äôs function based on its sequence or predicted structure |

## üß™ Use Cases in Drug Discovery

| Application | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Target Identification** | Predict if a protein is involved in a disease pathway |
| **Binding Site Prediction** | Identify potential pockets for drug docking or ligand binding |
| **Mutational Impact Modeling** | Understand how mutations affect protein stability/function (e.g., in rare diseases or cancer) |
| **Antibody Design** | Predict the binding efficiency of antibody-antigen interactions |
| **Synthetic Protein Engineering** | Design novel proteins with specific activities or stability profiles |

## ü§ñ ML Models Used

| Model Type | Role |
|------------|------|
| **Protein LLMs (e.g., ESM-2, ProtBERT, ProtT5)** | Learn representations from sequences to predict structure/function |
| **AlphaFold 2 / 3** | Predict 3D structure from amino acid sequence |
| **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** | Represent 3D atomic structure to predict function or interaction |
| **Contrastive Models** | Learn embeddings where proteins with similar function are closer |

---
- Immunogenicity modeling
**Immunogenicity** refers to the ability of a substance ‚Äî especially a **therapeutic protein or biologic drug** ‚Äî to provoke an **immune response** in the body.

In drug development, this is a **double-edged sword**:
- **Good** in vaccines (you *want* a strong immune response)
- **Bad** in biologics (immune reaction can **neutralize the drug**, reduce efficacy, or cause side effects)

---

## üî¨ What is Immunogenicity Modeling?

**Immunogenicity modeling** involves building **computational tools and machine learning models** to **predict** whether a protein or peptide is likely to trigger an immune response ‚Äî particularly the **adaptive immune system** (e.g., T cells, antibodies).

---

## üß™ Why It Matters

| Risk | Impact |
|------|--------|
| **Neutralizing antibodies** | Can deactivate therapeutic proteins |
| **Hypersensitivity reactions** | May lead to serious side effects or treatment discontinuation |
| **Low efficacy** | Immune clearance lowers drug concentration |
| **Regulatory concern** | EMA & FDA require strong immunogenicity risk assessments |

## üîç Modeling Focus Areas

| Task | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Epitope Prediction** | Identify peptide regions likely to be presented by MHC molecules and recognized by T cells |
| **MHC Binding Affinity** | Predict how strongly a peptide binds to MHC Class I or II |
| **T-cell Receptor (TCR) Reactivity** | Model the likelihood that a TCR recognizes a presented peptide |
| **Sequence Liability Scanning** | Identify mutations or regions increasing immunogenic risk |
| **Deimmunization** | Suggest edits to reduce immunogenicity while preserving function |
